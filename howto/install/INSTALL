------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU NEED
------------------------------------------------

** Java SDK (j2sdk-1.4.2._0X)
http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html

** PostgreSQL (7.3.X or later)
postgresql-server-7.3.X (Server)
postgresql-7.3.X (Client applications)

** Tomcat (4.1.31)
http://apache.roweboat.net/jakarta/tomcat-4/v4.1.31/bin/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.31-LE-jdk14.tar.gz
In case this link doesn't work go here http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html and download similar version. We do prefer 4.1.X branch but it's on you if you'd like to try newer versions.

** CReaM
cream-2.0.0.tar.gz


------------------------------------------------
HOW TO INSTALL
------------------------------------------------

** Java SDK
- install Java SDK let's say to /usr/local
- export java home (export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.2_0X)
- you should probably put this export to the '/etc/profile' file

** PostgreSQL database
- login as root
- change postgresql.conf (tcpip_socket = true)
- take a look at pg_hba.conf (uncomment rights for localhost to have something like this 'host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust')
- start postgresql server (/etc/init.d/postgresql start)
- type 'su postgres'
- create user cream (createuser -a -d -P cream)
- enter password 'cream' for user cream
- create database cream (createdb -E UTF-8 cream)
- start psql (psql cream)
- create tables for cream (\i cream.sql)
- don't pay attention on errors, script tries to drop non existing tables before it creates new ones
- exit from psql (\q)
- logout from postgres user account (exit)
- logout from root user account (exit)

** Tomcat & CReaM
- extract Tomcat tar and copy it to let's say '/usr/local' directory
- extract Cream tar and copy it to Tomcat's '/webapps/cream' directory
- if your PostgreSQL server is newer, go here 'http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html' and download JDBC driver for
 your database version. Copy that file to '{Tomcat installation}/webapps/cream/WEB-INF/lib' directory.
- edit 'cream.properties' file from '{Tomcat installation}/webapps/cream/WEB-INF/conf' directory, set email properties and turn the scheduler on to start receiving emails
- run 'startup.sh' from tomcat's '/bin' directory


------------------------------------------------
HOW TO START
------------------------------------------------

** Browser
- open your browser (IE 6.0+, Firefox 1.0+ or Mozilla 1.3+)
- because Cream comes with different localizations, set prefered language as default in your browser (somewhere in the browser preferences)
- type url 'http://your_server:8080/cream/app/'
- login as user 'admin' with password 'admn00'
- create new roles and new users
- logout as admin
- login as some user
- create some options
- create some products
- create some campaigns
- create some customers
- start using Cream

Good luck! :-)
