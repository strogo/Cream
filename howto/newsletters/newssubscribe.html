	/* 1.1.2: Fixed a bug where trailing . in e-mail address was passing
		(the bug is actually in the weak regexp engine of the browser; I
		simplified the regexps to make it work).
	1.1.1: Removed restriction that countries must be preceded by a domain,
		so abc@host.uk is now legal.  However, there's still the 
		restriction that an address must end in a two or three letter
		word.
	1.1: Rewrote most of the function to conform more closely to RFC 822.
	1.0: Original  */
