To localize Cream user interface, open the 'Cream_en.translation' file in some editor, translate right parts of the properties and save the file as, for example, Cream_fr.translation (in case you would localize to French language).

Now, find 'native2ascii' executable in the bin directory of your Java installation (for example /usr/local/j2sdk1.4.2_01/bin/native2ascii) and run it this way:

/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.2_01/bin/native2ascii -encoding CP1252 Cream_fr.translation Cream_fr.properties

This would create 'Cream_fr.properties' file. Copy this file to /webapps/cream/WEB-INF/classes directory. Set French language as default in your browser (somewhere in the browser preferences) and login into Cream.

Please, pay attention on the code page (e.g CP1252 etc.) for your language. You can find the appropriate one here:

Enjoy!
